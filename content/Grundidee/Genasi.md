## Genasi Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid

**Size:** Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)

**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Genasi, you have this special traits.

**_Elemental Heritage._** You must choose among one of four major subspecies of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi.

### Air Genasi

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

**_Unending Breath._** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.

**_Mingle with the Wind._** You can cast the levitate spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Earth Genasi

As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

**_Earth Walk._** You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.

**_Merge with Stone._** You can cast the "pass without trace"-spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Fire Genasi

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

**_Darkvision._** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Fire Resistance._** You have resistance to fire damage.

**_Reach to the Blaze._** You know the "produce flame" cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the "burning hands" spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. The spellcasing ability for these spells is charisma, intelligence, or wisdom.

### Water Genasi

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

**_Amphibious._** You can breathe air and water.

**Acid Resistance._** You have resistance to acid damage.

**_Call to the Wave._** You know the "shape water" cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the "create or destroy water" spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. The spellcasing ability for these spells is charisma, intelligence, or wisdom.

**Swim._** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
